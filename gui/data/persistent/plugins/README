Plugin local configuration files

Introduction

This directory allow to store plugin local configuration files. This allow to override the default plugin parameters
defined in the default configuration files in persistent way, without having to restore them after updating your plugin
to a newer version. It's the responsability of the admin to check that parameters added in these files still apply to
the newest plugin version.

When a local configuration file is found for a plugin, both, the default configuration file and the local configuration
file are merged together. Parameters defined in the local configuration file take precedence over those defined in
default configuration file.

To avoid any accidental configuration loss, the local configuration files are never automatically deleted.

Local configuration file naming convention

Local configuration files *MUST* be named with plugin name followed by the php file extension such as: JailKit.php

Local configuration file sample

JailKit.php file:

<?php
return array(
	// Override default installation path
	'install_path' => '/usr'
);

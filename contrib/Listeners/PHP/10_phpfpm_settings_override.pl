## Configuration parameters
#

# Allows to override PHP-FPM settings in pool configuration files
#
# This listener is only compatible with the fpm PHP SAPI.
#
# PHP configuration level (Per site, per domain or per user FPM settings):
#
# Depending on the PHP configuration level set for a given customer, this
# listener file acts differently:
#
# - Per site   : FPM settings can be set for the main domain, domain aliases
#                and subdomains. FPM settings set will apply only to the
#                targeted domain, domain alias or subdomain.
#
# - Per domain : FPM settings can be set for the main domain and domain aliases
#                only. FPM settings set for the main domain will also apply to
#                the main domain's subdomains, and PHP directives set for domain
#                aliases will also apply to domain aliases's subdomains.
#
# - Per user   : FPM settings can be set for the main domain name only. They
#                will apply to the main domain, domain aliases and subdomains.
#
# The PHP configuration level is set on a per customer basis. You can change it
# for a specific customer as follows:
#
#  1. Connect as administrator and edit the PHP settings for the customer'
#     reseller, then set the PHP configuration level that fit your needs.
#  2. Connect as reseller and edit the PHP settings for the customer, then set
#     the PHP configuration level that fit your needs.
#


# Note that domain names must be in ASCII format.
my %SETTINGS = (
    # Global FPM settings 
    # These settings apply to all domains.
    '*'               => {
        pm                        => 'ondemand',

        'pm.process_idle_timeout' => '60s',
        'pm.max_requests'         => 1000
    },

    # Per site, per domain or per user FPM settings
    # FPM settings added here apply according the current PHP
    # configuration level that is set for the customer that owns the domain.
    # These settings have higher precedence than global settings.

# i-MSCP 1.4.x Serie -- Errata

First of all, if you're updating from a older i-MSCP Serie, you should read the archived errata files that you can
find in the ./docs directory of the i-MSCP archive.

## Version 1.4.4

### Distributions

Support for Devuan Jessie 1.0 RC has been added. See https://devuan.org/ for further details about the Devuan project.

### Event listener priorities (backend)

Backend event listeners can now be registered with an optional priority (default to 1). Listeners registered with
highest priorities are executed first. For instance:

```perl
iMSCP::EventManager->getInstance( )->register( 'testing', sub { print "First registered listener\n", -99 );
iMSCP::EventManager->getInstance( )->register( 'testing', sub { print "Second registered listener\n", 10 );
iMSCP::EventManager->getInstance( )->register( 'testing', sub { print "Third registered listener\n" );
iMSCP::EventManager->getInstance( )->register( 'testing', sub { print "Fourth registered listener\n", 1 );
iMSCP::EventManager->getInstance( )->trigger( 'testing' );
```
will output:
```
Second registered listener
Third registered listener
Fourth registered listener
First registered listener
```

### Network setup

It is now possible to select the `0.0.0.0` IP address while setup-in or reconfiguring i-MSCP. The 0.0.0.0 IP address
means that servers such as Nginx, Apache2... will listen on all interfaces. This option is more suitable for cloud
computing services such as Scaleway.

See also: [i-MSCP with a Scaleway (cloud computing service) server](https://i-mscp.net/index.php/Thread/16645-i-MSCP-with-a-Scaleway-cloud-computing-service-server/)


### Plugin errors handling (Backend)

Plugin errors, outside of those raised by the plugin handler (Module::Plugin), are no longer returned to the caller.
That means that an error which has been raised by a plugin will no longer cause a general failure.

This change should help mitigate upgrade errors caused by plugins that are not compatible with new i-MSCP version.
If an error is raised by a plugin, that plugin will be left in inconsistent state and the administrator will have to
solve the situation through the plugin management interface.


## Version 1.4.3

### Apache2 version (Ubuntu Trusty Thar)

Apache2 (2.4.10) is now installed through the backports repository. This allow us to not longer depends on the Apache2
fastcgi module when the PHP SAPI is FPM.

### Distribution packages files

Distribution packages files were updated. If you're using the `10_packages_override.pl` i-MSCP listener file to override
your distirbution packages file, don't forget to sync it.

### Maildir++ quota information

Maildir++ quota information were re-added in the frontEnd (client interface). The quota information are now extracted
from each mailbox `maildirsize` file and are cached in session for 5 minutes. Note that if the file doesn't exists yet,
no quota information will be showed.

In case of Courier IMAP/POP server, the maildirsize file is automatically created on mailbox account creation/update
while in case of Dovecot IMAP/POP server usage, it is created on first IMAP login. Note that if there is not quota set
for a mailbox, no quota information will be showed.

## Version 1.4.1

### Apache2 vlogger script

Due to an important bug found in vlogger script, and that has been fixed in this new version, it is recommended to run
the following command to make sure that there is no vlogger process left on your system before upgrading:

```
# pkill -KILL -f vlogger
```

## Version 1.4.0

### Distributions

- Support for Debian Wheezy has been dropped - Softwares and libraries were too old
- Support for Ubuntu Precise Pangolin (12.04) has been dropped. - Anticipating EOL on April 2017

### Httpd server (Apache2) vhost templates 

Several Apache2 vhost templates were merged.

- The domain_redirect.tpl, domain_redirect_ssl.tpl and domain_ssl.tpl templates were merged in the domain.tpl template
- The domain_disabled_ssl.tpl template has been merged in the domain_disabled.tpl template

From now, if you need to known the context of the Apache2 vhost template when developing a plugin or a listener file,
you must use the new `VHOST_TYPE` parameter that is passed to event listeners. For instance, in the
`40_apache2_security_headers.pl` listener file, we are testing the context as follow:

```perl
        return 0 unless $tplName eq 'domain.tpl'
            && grep( $_ eq $data->{'VHOST_TYPE'}, ( 'domain', 'domain_ssl' ) );
```

See [40_apache2_security_headers.pl](https://github.com/i-MSCP/imscp/blob/1.4.x/contrib/Listeners/Apache2/40_apache2_security_headers.pl)
for further details.

The value of the `VHOST_TYPE` parameter can be one of the following:

- `domain`: Vhost for domains
- `domain_ssl`: SSL Vhost for domains
- `domain_fwd`: Vhost for forwarded (redirected, proxied) domains
- `domain_ssl_fwd`: SSL vhost for forwarded (redirected, proxied) domains
- `domain_disabled`: Vhost for disabled domains
- `domain_disabled_ssl`: SSL vhost for disabled domains
- `domain_disabled_fwd`: Vhost that forwards http requests to https for disabled domains

Note: Here a domain is either a domain, a domain alias or a subdomain.

### i-MSCP log files

There is now only one log file per module. In other words, event logging is now made on a per module basis. Before,
event logging was made on a per item basis, possibly leading to hundred files stored in the /var/log/imscp directory.

There are no reasons to keep logs for all processed items. Generally speaking, administrator only has interest for logs
of last processed item, mostly when there was an error raised.

Note that the Modules::Plugin module is not concerned by those changes.

### Listener files

Many listener files were updated according changes made in this new version, specially the Apache2 listener files. If
you use one or many of them, you should update them.

### Passwords storage

All passwords are now stored using a scheme other than `PLAIN` to prevent anybody with access to the i-MSCP database
(such as a hacker) from stealing users' passwords and using them to access other services.

#### Ftp user passwords

The `rawpasswd` plaintext password column has been removed from the i-MSCP database. The password scheme for FTP users
is still unchanged (SHA512-crypt).

#### Mail account passwords

New password scheme for Mail accounts is `SHA512-crypt`. We chose SHA512-crypt because it is supported by all software
products integrated with i-MSCP. Update is automatic. Mail account passwords will be hashed automatically during upgrade.

Be aware that due to this change, only the `plaintext` authentication mechanisms (PLAIN, LOGIN) are now supported. This
is due to the fact that non-plaintext authentication mechanisms require either plaintext passwords or password scheme
that belongs to the chosen authentication mechanism. To avoid problems with plaintext passwords that are sent during
authentication processes, it is recommended to use SSL/TLS connections only.

You must not forget to inform your customers about this change. Mail clients configured to use authentication
mechanisms such as MD5-CRAM will fail to authenticate.

#### SQL user passwords

The `sqlu_pass` plaintext password column has been removed from the i-MSCP database.

### PHP support

PHP support is now provided through Ondřej Surý repository or PPA. As reminder, Ondřej Surý is the official
Debian/Ubuntu maintainer for PHP packaging.

Note that PHP versions that are considered EOL by upstream PHP team are no longer supported.

#### PHP versions

It is now possible to choose between many PHP versions through the installer. At this time, PHP `5.6`, `7.0` and `7.1`
are available. You can switch to another PHP version by executing the following commands:

```
# cd <imscp_archive_dir>
# perl imscp-autoinstall -dr php
```

Note that this new feature is not a replacement for the PhpSwitcher plugin. Without the PhpSwitcher plugin, there is
no way to provide multiple PHP versions to customers.

### PhpMyAdmin and Pydio auto-login feature

The auto-login feature providing customers with a button to auto-logon in PhpMyAdmin or Pydio without having to provide
login data has been removed. One of requirement for that feature are plaintext passwords that are now removed for
security reasons. An alternative method will be implemented in a later release.

### Postfix SASL authentication backend

SASL authentication backend used by the Postfix MTA depends on the PO server in use (Dovecot or Courier).

- Courier: Postfix MTA uses Cyrus SASL as authentication backend. Courier authentication library (authdaemon) is used as
password verifier.
- Dovecot: Postfix MTA uses Dovecot SASL as authentication backend.

### Web folder skeletons (default /.well-known directory)

The `/.well-known` directory has been added to domain, domain alias and subdomain Web folder skeletons. From now, the
`/.well-known` directory will be automatically created on new domain, domain alias or subdomain creation. This directory
is stored inside of the default document root: `./htdocs/.well-known`. Be aware that if you change the document root
through the i-MSCP control panel, that directory will be no longer reachable.

#### Note regarding the i-MSCP LetsEncrypt plugin

The LetsEncrypt plugin comes with its own directory for serving ACME resources. To make this to work, the plugin defines
a specific Apache2 alias on the `/.well-known/acme-challenge/` URL path. In that specific case, ACME resources are not
served from the default `/.well-known` directory. These are served from the directory of the LetsEncrypt plugin. Note
that this only apply to ACME resources.

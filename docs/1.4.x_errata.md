# i-MSCP 1.4.x Serie -- Errata

First of all, if you're updating from a older i-MSCP Serie, you should read the archived errata files that you can
find in the ./docs directory of the i-MSCP archive.

## Version 1.4.0

### Distributions

- Support for Debian Wheezy has been dropped - Softwares and libraries are too old
- Support for Ubuntu Precise Pangolin (12.04) has been dropped. - EOL on April 2017

### Httpd server (Apache2) vhost templates 

Several Apache2 vhost template files where merged together:

- The domain_redirect.tpl, domain_redirect_ssl.tpl and domain_ssl.tpl templates were merged in the domain.tpl template
- The domain_disabled_ssl.tpl template has been merged in the domain_disabled.tpl template

From now, if you need to known the context of the template when developing a plugin or a listener file, you must use the
new dynamic `VHOST_TYPE` parameter that is passed to event listeners. For instance, for the
`40_apache2_security_headers.pl` listener file, we are testing the context as follow:

```perl
        return 0 unless $tplName eq 'domain.tpl'
            && grep( $_ eq $data->{'VHOST_TYPE'}, ( 'domain', 'domain_ssl' ) );
```

See [40_apache2_security_headers.pl](https://github.com/i-MSCP/imscp/blob/1.4.x/contrib/Listeners/Apache2/40_apache2_security_headers.pl)
for further details.

The value of the dynamic `VHOST_TYPE` parameter can be one of the following:

- `domain`: http vhost for domains
- `domain_ssl`: https vhost for domains
- `domain_fwd`: http vhost for forwarded (redirected, proxied) domains
- `domain_ssl_fwd`: https vhost for forwarded (redirected, proxied) domains
- `domain_disabled`: http vhost for disabled domains
- `domain_disabled_ssl`: https vhost for disabled domains
- `domain_disabled_fwd`: vhost that forwards http requests to https for disabled domains

### i-MSCP log files

There is now only one log file per module. In other words, event logging is now made on a per module basis. Before,
event logging was made on a per item basis, possibly leading to hundred files stored in the /var/log/imscp directory.

There are no reasons to keep logs for all processed items. Generally speaking, administrator only has interest for logs
of last processed item, mostly when there was an error raised.

Note that the Modules::Plugin module is not concerned by those changes.

### Passwords storage

All passwords are now stored using a scheme other than `PLAIN` to prevent anybody with access to the i-MSCP database
(such as a hacker) from stealing users' passwords and using them to access other services.

#### Ftp user passwords

The `rawpasswd` plaintext password column has been removed from the i-MSCP database. The password scheme for FTP users
is still unchanged (SHA512-crypt).

#### Mail account passwords

New password scheme for Mail accounts is `SHA512-crypt`. We chose SHA512-crypt because it is supported by all software
products integrated with i-MSCP. Update is automatic. Mail account passwords will be hashed automatically during upgrade.

Be aware that due to this change, only the `plaintext` authentication mechanisms (PLAIN, LOGIN) are now supported. This
is due to the fact that non-plaintext authentication mechanisms require either plaintext passwords or password scheme
that belongs to the chosen authentication mechanism. To avoid problems with plaintext passwords that are sent during
authentication processes, it is recommended to use SSL/TLS connections only.

You must not forget to inform your customers about this change. Mail clients configured to use authentication
mechanisms such as MD5-CRAM will fail to authenticate.

#### SQL user passwords

The `sqlu_pass` plaintext password column has been removed from the i-MSCP database.

### PHP support

PHP support is now provided through Ondřej Surý repository or PPA. As reminder, Ondřej Surý is the official
Debian/Ubuntu maintainer for PHP packaging.

Note that PHP versions that are considered EOL by upstream PHP team are no longer supported.

#### PHP versions

It is now possible to choose between many PHP versions through the installer. At this time, PHP `5.6`, `7.0` and `7.1`
are available. You can switch to another PHP version by executing the following commands:

```
# cd <imscp_archive_dir>
# perl imscp-autoinstall -dr php
```

Note that this new feature is not a replacement for the PhpSwitcher plugin. Without the PhpSwitcher plugin, there is
no way to provide multiple PHP versions to customers.

### PhpMyAdmin and Pydio auto-login feature

The auto-login feature providing customers with a button to auto-logon in PhpMyAdmin or Pydio without having to provide
login data has been removed. One of requirement for that feature are plaintext passwords that are now removed for
security reasons. An alternative method will be implemented in a later release.

### Postfix SASL authentication backend

SASL authentication backend used by the Postfix MTA depends on the PO server in use (Dovecot or Courier).

- Courier: Postfix MTA uses Cyrus SASL as authentication backend. Courier authentication library (authdaemon) is used as
password verifier.
- Dovecot: Postfix MTA uses Dovecot SASL as authentication backend.

### Web folder skeletons (default /.well-known directory)

The `.well-known` directory has been added to domain, alias and subdomain Web folder skeletons. From now, the
`/.well-known` directory will be automatically created on new domain, alias or subdomain creation. This directory is
stored inside of the default document root: `./htdocs/.well-known`. Be aware that if you change the document root
through the i-MSCP control panel, that directory will be no longer reachable.

#### Note regarding the i-MSCP LetsEncrypt plugin

The LetsEncrypt plugin comes with its own directory for serving ACME resources. To make this to work, the plugin defines
a specific alias on the `/.well-/known/acme-challenge/` URL path. In that specific case, ACME resources are not served
from the default `/.well-known` directory. These are served from the directory of the LetsEncrypt plugin. Note that this
apply only to ACME resources.

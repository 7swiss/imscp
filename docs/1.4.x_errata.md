# i-MSCP 1.4.x -- Errata

First of all, if you're updating from an older i-MSCP Serie, you should read the archived errata files that you can
find in the ./docs directory of the i-MSCP archive.

## Update to version 1.4.0

### PHP alternatives (Debian only)

It is now possible to choose alternative PHP versions through the installer. For instance, under Debian Jessie, it is
now possible to choose between PHP 5.6 (default), or PHP 7.0 (provided through Dotdeb repository).

You can switch to an alternative PHP version by running the following commands:

    # cd <imscp_archive_dir>
    # perl imscp-autoinstall -dr php

However, note that alternative PHP versions are not a replacement for the PhpSwitcher plugin. They only allow change of
the default PHP version (a.k.a. system PHP version). Without the PhpSwitcher plugin, there is still no way to provide
multiple PHP versions to your customers.

### PhpMyAdmin and Pydio auto-login feature

The auto-login feature providing customers with a button to auto-login into PhpMyAdmin or Pydio without enter login data
has been removed. One of requirement for that feature are plaintext passwords that are removed in the Serie 1.4.x. An
alternative method will be implemented in a  later release.

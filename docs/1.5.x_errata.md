# i-MSCP 1.5.x Serie (Ennio Morricone) -- Errata

First of all, if you're updating from an older i-MSCP Serie, you **MUST** read
the previous errata files that you can find in the [./docs](.) directory.

## Version 1.5.3 (build <build>)

Bugfixe release.
 
### Supported distributions

#### Ubuntu Bionic Beaver (18.04)

Support for Ubuntu Bionic Beaver (18.04) has been added. However, you **MUST**
read the below notes carefully, especially if you intent to install i-MSCP on
a fresh Ubuntu installation, that is, not being upgraded from older version
such as Ubuntu Xenial Xerus (16.04).

##### netplan.io

As per [release notes](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BionicBeaver/ReleaseNotes),
`ifupdown` has been deprecated in favor of [netplan.io](https://netplan.io/).
Because i-MSCP 1.5.3 doesn't provide any networking configuration provider for
`netplan.io`, you need first switch-back to `ifupdown`. See the accepted answer
on the [ASk Ubuntu community](https://askubuntu.com/a/1052023/846411) site for
the procedure to follows.

The `netplan.io` networking configuration provider will be added in next i-MSCP
stable version.

##### SQL server (Percona packages)

Percona packages are provided only for amd64 architecture.

## Version 1.5.3 (build 20180516)

Maintenance release.

## Version 1.5.2

Canceled release.

## Version 1.5.1 (build 20170908)

Maintenance release.

## Version 1.5.0 (build 20170905)

Minor release (stable release).

### Mail accounts

#### Default mail accounts

Default mail accounts are now protected by default. However, the system
administrator can always disable the protection through the administrator
settings interface.

As a reminder, default mail accounts are a restricted list taken from those
that are listed in the [RFC 2142](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2142.txt).

The following default mail accounts are created:

- abuse      (Customer Relations)
- hostmaster (DNS service)
- postmaster (SMTP service)
- webmaster  (HTTPD service)

Beware that unprotecting default mail accounts is discouraged. These accounts
are needed.

It is important to note that if default mail accounts are not protected and that
a customer turn a default mail account into a normal mail account, that last will
no longer be seen as a default mail account.

#### Mail accounts accounting

##### Catch-all accounts

Catch-all accounts are now counted in the customer mail accounts limit. These
accounts behave like foward mail accounts for an entire domain and therefore,
there are no valid reasons to discard them from the mail accounts limit.

### Cosmetics (frontEnd)

#### Unlimited objects

Unlimited objects, whatever their nature, are now represented by the `âˆž`
mathematical infiny symbol.

### Output compression (FrontEnd)

Output compression at the frontEnd side has been removed. Output is compressed
at the Nginx Web server level.

Note that all related parameters were also removed.

### Userland cache (FrontEnd)

The frontEnd now make use of the [APCu](http://php.net/manual/en/book.apcu.php)
userland cache for caching of several resources such as localization,
translation, service statuses. This list is non exhaustive.

If for any reason, the APCu extension is not available, there is a fallback to
another but more slower cache backend (File caching).

Bear in mind that on production systems, it is really important to disable the
`DEBUG` mode by setting the `DEBUG` configuration parameter to `0` in your
`/etc/imscp/imscp.conf` file. If you don't do so, access to the frontEnd will
be really slow and a warning will be showed at the administrator UI level.

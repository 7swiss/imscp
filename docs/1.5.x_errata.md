# i-MSCP 1.5.x Serie (Ennio Morricone) -- Errata

First of all, if you're updating from an older i-MSCP Serie, you **MUST** read
the previous errata files that you can find in the [./docs](.) directory.

## Version <release> (build <release_build>)

Bugfixes release.

### Plugins

In previous versions, it was possible to update the plugins regardless of their
current state, that is, even if a task was already running for them. This is
now disallowed to avoid inconsistent states. An identical restriction has been
added for the plugins configuration update.

In other words:

- A plugin can be updated/reconfigured only if it is in consistent state, and
if there is not a task already running for it.
- On error state, a plugin can be reconfigured. However, a new attempt for the
failed task will not be triggered automatically. The administrator will have to
do it manually.

## Version 1.5.3 (build 2018120800)

Bugfixes release.

## Version 1.5.3 (build 2018120700)

Bugfixes release.
 
### Networking configuration providers

A new networking configuration provider for [netplan.io](https://netplan.io/)
has been added. Note that the `networkd` renderer is assumed.
 
### PHP distribution packages
 
PHP distributions packages are not longer automatically purged, even if they
don't match selected PHP version. This is required for 3rd-party software such
as the PhpSwitcher plugin which could rely on additional packaged PHP versions.
 
### Supported distributions

#### Ubuntu Bionic Beaver (18.04)

Support for Ubuntu Bionic Beaver (18.04) has been added.

##### SQL server (Percona packages)

Percona packages are provided only for amd64 architecture.

## Version 1.5.3 (build 20180516)

Maintenance release.

## Version 1.5.2

Canceled release.

## Version 1.5.1 (build 20170908)

Maintenance release.

## Version 1.5.0 (build 20170905)

Minor release (stable release).

### Mail accounts

#### Default mail accounts

Default mail accounts are now protected by default. However, the system
administrator can always disable the protection through the administrator
settings interface.

As a reminder, default mail accounts are a restricted list taken from those
that are listed in the [RFC 2142](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2142.txt).

The following default mail accounts are created:

- abuse      (Customer Relations)
- hostmaster (DNS service)
- postmaster (SMTP service)
- webmaster  (HTTPD service)

Beware that unprotecting default mail accounts is discouraged. These accounts
are needed.

It is important to note that if default mail accounts are not protected and that
a customer turn a default mail account into a normal mail account, that last will
no longer be seen as a default mail account.

#### Mail accounts accounting

##### Catch-all accounts

Catch-all accounts are now counted in the customer mail accounts limit. These
accounts behave like foward mail accounts for an entire domain and therefore,
there are no valid reasons to discard them from the mail accounts limit.

### Cosmetics (frontEnd)

#### Unlimited objects

Unlimited objects, whatever their nature, are now represented by the `âˆž`
mathematical infiny symbol.

### Output compression (FrontEnd)

Output compression at the frontEnd side has been removed. Output is compressed
at the Nginx Web server level.

Note that all related parameters were also removed.

### Userland cache (FrontEnd)

The frontEnd now make use of the [APCu](http://php.net/manual/en/book.apcu.php)
userland cache for caching of several resources such as localization,
translation, service statuses. This list is non exhaustive.

If for any reason, the APCu extension is not available, there is a fallback to
another but more slower cache backend (File caching).

Bear in mind that on production systems, it is really important to disable the
`DEBUG` mode by setting the `DEBUG` configuration parameter to `0` in your
`/etc/imscp/imscp.conf` file. If you don't do so, access to the frontEnd will
be really slow and a warning will be showed at the administrator UI level.

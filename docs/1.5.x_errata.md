# i-MSCP 1.5.x Serie (Ennio Morricone) -- Errata

First of all, if you're updating from an older i-MSCP Serie, you **MUST** read
the previous errata files that you can find in the [./docs](.) directory.

## Version <release> (build <release_build>)

Bugfixes release with few enhancements.

### Pre-update tasks

Due to important changes in the backend, you need stop the following service
manually prior updating:

- imscp_daemon
- imscp_mountall
- imscp_panel
- imscp_traffic

### Database tasks processor - Error propagation

In the previous versions, an error raised during the processing of an entity
(domain, subdomain...) was always propagated to the database task processor
which caused it to abort immediately. This behavior was not appropriate because
independent entities for which a task was scheduled were not processed.

From now on, only the status of the entities for which an error has been raised
is updated. If an entity is in error state, the administrator will have to look
at the debugger UI.

### Overriding of default DNS resource records

It is now possible to override any default DNS resource record through the
custom DNS resource records interface.

To do so, the custom DNS resource records are now injected at runtime and are
no longer stored in the intermediate db zone file. Doing this make possible to
re-inject default DNS records more easily when those are not longer overridden
by custom DNS resource records.

Following this change, the `10_named_override_default_rr.pl` listener file has
been dropped. If you make use of that listener, you **MUST** not forget to
remove it from your i-MSCP installation prior updating. overriding of default
DNS resource record **MUST** now be done through the custom DNS resource records
interface.

### Plugins

In previous versions, it was possible to update the plugins regardless of their
current state, that is, even if a task was already pending for them. This is
now disallowed to avoid inconsistent states. An identical restriction has been
added for the plugins configuration update.

In other words:

- A plugin can be updated/reconfigured only if it is in consistent state, and
if there is not a pending task for it.
- On error state, a plugin can be reconfigured. However, a new attempt for the
failed task will not be triggered automatically. The administrator will have to
do it manually.

### Services disruption while i-MSCP update/reconfiguration

In previous versions, most of services (httpd, ftp, imap/pop, smtp...) were
stopped during an i-MSCP update or reconfiguration. That's no longer the case.
This decision was taken to avoid unnecessary service disruption.

### Software installer

The component for automatic Web software installation has been removed for
security reasons. The software packages were not maintained since more than two
years by their respective authors, and the component itself was relying on a
library inherited from the VHCS project which was deprecated since several years.

Following that removal, all hosting plans will be dropped during update. You'll
have to re-create them once the update is done.

## Version 1.5.3 (build 2018120800)

Bugfixes release.

## Version 1.5.3 (build 2018120700)

Bugfixes release.
 
### Networking configuration providers

A new networking configuration provider for [netplan.io](https://netplan.io/)
has been added. Note that the `networkd` renderer is assumed.
 
### PHP distribution packages
 
PHP distributions packages are not longer automatically purged, even if they
don't match selected PHP version. This is required for 3rd-party software such
as the PhpSwitcher plugin which could rely on additional packaged PHP versions.
 
### Supported distributions

#### Ubuntu Bionic Beaver (18.04)

Support for Ubuntu Bionic Beaver (18.04) has been added.

##### SQL server (Percona packages)

Percona packages are provided only for amd64 architecture.

## Version 1.5.3 (build 20180516)

Maintenance release.

## Version 1.5.2

Canceled release.

## Version 1.5.1 (build 20170908)

Maintenance release.

## Version 1.5.0 (build 20170905)

Minor release (stable release).

### Mail accounts

#### Default mail accounts

Default mail accounts are now protected by default. However, the system
administrator can always disable the protection through the administrator
settings interface.

As a reminder, default mail accounts are a restricted list taken from those
that are listed in the [RFC 2142](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2142.txt).

The following default mail accounts are created:

- abuse      (Customer Relations)
- hostmaster (DNS service)
- postmaster (SMTP service)
- webmaster  (HTTPD service)

Beware that unprotecting default mail accounts is discouraged. These accounts
are needed.

It is important to note that if default mail accounts are not protected and that
a customer turn a default mail account into a normal mail account, that last will
no longer be seen as a default mail account.

#### Mail accounts accounting

##### Catch-all accounts

Catch-all accounts are now counted in the customer mail accounts limit. These
accounts behave like foward mail accounts for an entire domain and therefore,
there are no valid reasons to discard them from the mail accounts limit.

### Cosmetics (frontEnd)

#### Unlimited objects

Unlimited objects, whatever their nature, are now represented by the `âˆž`
mathematical infiny symbol.

### Output compression (FrontEnd)

Output compression at the frontEnd side has been removed. Output is compressed
at the Nginx Web server level.

Note that all related parameters were also removed.

### Userland cache (FrontEnd)

The frontEnd now make use of the [APCu](http://php.net/manual/en/book.apcu.php)
userland cache for caching of several resources such as localization,
translation, service statuses. This list is non exhaustive.

If for any reason, the APCu extension is not available, there is a fallback to
another but more slower cache backend (File caching).

Bear in mind that on production systems, it is really important to disable the
`DEBUG` mode by setting the `DEBUG` configuration parameter to `0` in your
`/etc/imscp/imscp.conf` file. If you don't do so, access to the frontEnd will
be really slow and a warning will be showed at the administrator UI level.

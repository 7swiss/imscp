# i-MSCP 1.5.x Serie (Ennio Morricone) -- Errata

First of all, if you're updating from an older i-MSCP Serie, you **MUST** read
the previous errata files that you can find in the [./docs](.) directory.

## Version 1.5.4

### Distributions

Support for Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic Beaver) has been added. However, you must bear
in mind that the i-MSCP networking configuration provider for
[Netplan](https://netplan.io/) has not been backported to the `1.5.x` Serie
yet. This means that if you want use this new i-MSCP version with Ubuntu >=
18.04 (Bionic Beaver), you need first reinstall the `ifupdown` package and
configure your network through the `/etc/network/interfaces` configuration
file.

See [Howto get back to ifupdown](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1031709/ubuntu-18-04-switch-back-to-etc-network-interfaces/1052023#1052023)

### PHP

All available PHP versions are now installed, regardless of the selected PHP
version for the control panel and customers. Doing make it possible to enhance
the `PhpSwitcher` plugin by using packaged PHP versions instead of relying on
self-compiled PHP versions.

Note that you still need the `PhpSwitcher` plugin if you want make your
customers able to switch between different PHP versions. Without the
PhpSwitcher plugin, there are no way to switch between different PHP versions,
even if there are more than one version installed on the system. The i-MSCP
installer will disable unused PHP (FPM) versions to prevent them to start on
server boot.

At this time, the following PHP versions are installed: 5.6, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2.
Note that PHP 7.2 can not yet be selected for the control panel for
compatibility reasons. However, it can be selected for the customers.

## Version 1.5.3

### Mail accounts

#### Default mail accounts

Default mail accounts are now protected by default. However, the system
administrator can always disable the protection through the administrator
settings interface.

As a reminder, default mail accounts are a restricted list taken from those
that are listed in the [RFC 2142](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2142.txt).

The following default mail accounts are created:

- abuse      (Customer Relations)
- hostmaster (DNS service)
- postmaster (SMTP service)
- webmaster  (HTTPD service)

Beware that unprotecting default mail accounts is discouraged. These accounts
are needed.

It is important to note that if default mail accounts are not protected and that
a customer turn a default mail account into a normal mail account, that last will
no longer be seen as a default mail account.

#### Mail accounts accounting

##### Catch-all accounts

Catch-all accounts are now counted in the customer mail accounts limit. These
accounts behave like foward mail accounts for an entire domain and therefore,
there are no valid reasons to discard them from the mail accounts limit.

### Cosmetics (frontEnd)

#### Unlimited objects

Unlimited objects, whatever their nature, are now represented by the `âˆž`
mathematical infiny symbol.

### Output compression (FrontEnd)

Output compression at the frontEnd side has been removed. Output is compressed
at the Nginx Web server level.

Note that all related parameters were also removed.

### Userland cache (FrontEnd)

The frontEnd now make use of the [APCu](http://php.net/manual/en/book.apcu.php)
userland cache for caching of several resources such as localization,
translation, service statuses. This list is non exhaustive.

If for any reason, the APCu extension is not available, there is a fallback to
another but more slower cache backend (File caching).

Bear in mind that on production systems, it is really important to disable the
`DEBUG` mode by setting the `DEBUG` configuration parameter to `0` in your
`/etc/imscp/imscp.conf` file. If you don't do so, access to the frontEnd will
be really slow and a warning will be showed at the administrator UI level.

# i-MSCP 1.5.x Serie (Ennio Morricone) -- Errata

First of all, if you're updating from an older i-MSCP Serie, you **MUST** read
the previous errata files that you can find in the [documentation](./) directory.

## Version 1.5.4

### Supported distributions

#### Devuan

Support for [Devuan ASCII](https://devuan.org/) has been added.

#### Ubuntu

Support for [Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic Beaver)](http://releases.ubuntu.com/releases/18.04/)
has been added. However, you must bear in mind that the i-MSCP networking
configuration provider for [Netplan](https://netplan.io/) has not been
backported to the `1.5.x` Serie yet. This means that if you want use this new
i-MSCP version with Ubuntu >= 18.04 (Bionic Beaver), you need first reinstall
the `ifupdown` package and configure your network through the
`/etc/network/interfaces` configuration file.

See [Howto get back to ifupdown](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1031709/ubuntu-18-04-switch-back-to-etc-network-interfaces/1052023#1052023)

### Installer

#### Distribution packages files

Several changes were made in the
[distribution packages files](../autoinstaller/Packages). If you make use of
your own packages file through an i-MSCP listener file, don't forget to fix
it prior running the installer.

#### Apache2 Web server

For Ubuntu distributions, the Apache2 Web server is now installed through the
[Ondřej Surý PPA](https://launchpad.net/~ondrej/+archive/ubuntu/apache2).

##### Supported TLS versions

TLS versions older than `v1.2` were disabled as those are not longer considered
safe, and some services such as Paypal won't work with older versions. See
[Paypal TLS 1.2 and HTTP/1.1 Upgrade](https://www.paypal.com/sg/webapps/mpp/tls-http-upgrade)
for further details.

If you need support older TLS versions, you can always edit the
`/etc/apache2/site-avaialble/00_nameserver.conf` file and change the following
configuration statement:
```apache2
SSLProtocol              all -SSLv2 -SSLv3 -TLSv1 -TLSv1.1
```
by
```apache2
SSLProtocol              all -SSLv2 -SSLv3
```

Once done, you *MUST* not forget to restart the `apache2` service.

#### PHP versions

All available PHP versions from Ondřej Surý are now installed, regardless of
the selected PHP version for the control panel and clients. Doing this make it
possible to enhance the PhpSwitcher plugin by using packaged PHP versions
instead of relying on self-compiled PHP versions.

Note that you still need the PhpSwitcher plugin if you want make your
clients able to switch between different PHP versions. Without the PhpSwitcher
plugin, there is no way to switch between different PHP versions, even if there
are more than one version installed on the system. The installer will disable
unused PHP (FPM) versions to prevent them to start on server boot.

At this time, the following PHP versions are installed: 5.6, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2.

Note that PHP 7.2 cannot be selected yet for the control panel for
compatibility reasons. However, it can be selected for the customers.

The PHP version for the control panel is set as default alternative at the
system level. You **MUST** not change the default system alternative for PHP
as the installer rely on that default.

#### Preseeding

The [preseeding template file](./preseed.pl) has been updated. If you make use of the
preseeding feature, don't forget to update your preseeding file.

#### SQL server

Support for MariaDB server 10.3 has been added.

### Core packages

#### Net2FTP (filemanager)

The Net2FTP package has been removed. The Net2FTP filemanager is no longer
maintained, making it unsafe.

#### Pydio (filemanager)

The Pydio package is still provided but is made available only when the PHP
5.6 version is selected for the control panel. We don't recommend usage of
Pydio as FTP Web filemanager. You **SHOULD** instead choose PHP 7.1 for the
control panel and MonstaFTP as Web filemanager.

#### PostfixSRS (SRS)

Support for Sender Rewriting Scheme (SRS) has been added. This service is
automatically installed and configured for any distribution providing the
`postsrsd` package.

If you do not want that service, you need to remove the package from the
distribution packages file and make sure the package is not installed on
your server prior running the installer.

See [postsrsd](https://github.com/roehling/postsrsd) for further details about
the purpose of that service.

#### Rspamd (antispam)

[Rspamd](https://rspamd.com/) has been integrated in core. Rspamd is a spam
filtering system written in C that provide much better performances than the
historical SpamAssassin solution. It comes with many features and can integrate
external softwares such as the ClamAV antivirus through modules.

Bear in mind that the Rspamd core integration is still in experimental state.

##### SpamAssassin plugin

If you currently make use of the SpamAssassin plugin and want switch to Rspamd,
you should really considere to uninstall it. Having both SpamAssassin and
Rspamd running on the same system can lead to serious performance penalties.

We highly recommend to switch to the Rspamd core integration as the
SpamAssassin plugin will be abandoned in a near future.

#### ClamAV (antivirus)

[ClamAV](https://www.clamav.net/) has been integrated in core. ClamAV is the
open source standard for mail gateway scanning software.

ClamAV is executed differently depending on whether or not you choose Rspamd
for the antispam solution. If you choose Rspamd, ClamAV is run through the
Rspamd antivirus module, otherwise it is run through ClamAV milter.

Bear in mind that the ClamAV core integration is still in experimental state.

##### ClamAV plugin

If you currently make use of the ClamAV plugin and want switch to the ClamAV
core integration, you should first uninstall the ClamAV plugin prior running
the installer. The behavior will be undefined if you have both the ClamAV core
integration and the ClamAV plugin enabled at the same time.

We highly recommend to switch to the ClamAV core integration as the ClamAV
plugin will be abandoned in a near future.

### Mail accounts

#### Default mail accounts

Default mail accounts are now protected by default. However, the system
administrator can always disable the protection through the administrator
settings interface.

As a reminder, default mail accounts are a restricted list taken from those
that are listed in the [RFC 2142](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2142.txt).

The following default mail accounts are created:

- abuse      (Customer Relations)
- hostmaster (DNS service)
- postmaster (SMTP service)
- webmaster  (HTTPD service)

Beware that unprotecting default mail accounts is discouraged. These accounts
are needed.

It is important to note that if default mail accounts are not protected and that
a customer turn a default mail account into a normal mail account, that last will
no longer be seen as a default mail account.

#### Mail accounts accounting

##### Catch-all accounts

Catch-all accounts are now counted in the customer mail accounts limit. These
accounts behave like foward mail accounts for an entire domain and therefore,
there are no valid reasons to discard them from the mail accounts limit.

### Cosmetics (frontEnd)

#### Unlimited objects

Unlimited objects, whatever their nature, are now represented by the `∞`
mathematical infiny symbol.

### Output compression (FrontEnd)

Output compression at the frontEnd side has been removed. Output is compressed
at the Nginx Web server level.

Note that all related parameters were also removed.

### Userland cache (FrontEnd)

The frontEnd now make use of the [APCu](http://php.net/manual/en/book.apcu.php)
userland cache for caching of several resources such as localization,
translation, service statuses. This list is non exhaustive.

If for any reason, the APCu extension is not available, there is a fallback to
another but more slower cache backend (File caching).

Bear in mind that on production systems, it is really important to disable the
`DEBUG` mode by setting the `DEBUG` configuration parameter to `0` in your
`/etc/imscp/imscp.conf` file. If you don't do so, access to the frontEnd will
be really slow and a warning will be showed at the administrator UI level.

512 MB RAM

================================================================================
3) Introduction
---------------
ispCP ω delivers a complete hosting automation appliance by offering significant
security, total-cost-of-ownership, and performance advantages over competing
commercial solutions.

With ispCP ω you can configure your server and applications, create user with
domains with a few point-and-click operations that take less than a minute.
There is no limit to the number of resellers, users and domains that can be
created. The core of ispCP ω are 3 easy-to-use, web-based control panels. ispCP
provides graphic user interfaces for the administrators, resellers and users.

================================================================================
4) SiteWide Mail protection solution
------------------------------------

Since ispCP Omega 1.0.7 rc3, both setup and update scripts are able to configure
a complete sitewide mail protection solution using Amavisd-new, SpamAssassin,
ClamAv and some other services such as razor...

If you want activate this solution, you should edit the i-mscp.conf file before
install/update ispCP ω Omega to activate the services that are part of this
solution.

You can also disable the mail protection solution by setting the proper values
to 'no' in the i-mscp.conf file (i-mscp.old.conf when update), and by running
again the ispCP ω Omega update script.

See the comments in the i-mscp.conf file for more information.

WARNING: Implementation of this solution is still experimental. You are warned!

5) Installation
---------------
First, make sure you are logged in as root.

1. Untar or unzip the distribution files to a secure directory:

	# cd /usr/local/src
	# tar xjvf i-mscp-omega-1.0.7.tar.bz2

2. Change to the newly created directory:

	# cd ./i-mscp-omega-1.0.7

3. Install the required repositories:

	# sh ./docs/OpenSuse/repositories.sh add

Note: For all questions, answer "a" (trust always).

4. install the required packages:

	First, update your distribution:
	# zypper dup

	# zypper in $(cat ./docs/OpenSuse/bin-packages)

5. Install the required Perl packages:

	First, update CPAN:
	# cpan CPAN

	# cpan $(cat ./docs/OpenSuse/perl-packages)

6. (optional) Check the i-mscp.conf and adapt it to your requirements.

7. Build the System by using make:

	# make -f Makefile.opensuse install

8. Copy all the directories into your system (you may make backups before):

	# cp -RLv /tmp/i-mscp/* /

9. Start MySQL, if it not already running:

	# rcmysql restart

10. Change or create MySQL root password, remove anonymous users, disallow root
	login remotely, remove test database (and access to it), reload privilege
	tables:

	# mysql_secure_installation

11. Maybe empty the folder /etc/skel - otherwise you'll have all the
	files/folders in the home folders:

	# cp -a /etc/skel /etc/skel.bkp
	# rm -r /etc/skel && mkdir /etc/skel

12. Now it's time to set up ispCP. Change into the engine directory and start
	the engine setup:

	# cd /srv/www/i-mscp/engine/setup
	# perl i-mscp-setup

13. Restore /etc/skel:

	# rm -r /etc/skel && mv /etc/skel.bkp /etc/skel

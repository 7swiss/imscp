# i-MSCP 1.6.x Serie (Alan Silvestri) -- Errata

First of all, if you're updating from an older i-MSCP Serie, you **MUST** read
the [previous errata](1.5.x_errata.md) file from bottom to top.

## Version 1.6.0

### Alternative URLs feature

Due to a bug found in previous versions, people that want make use of the
alternative URLs feature **MUST** run the installer as follows:

```shell
root@buster:/usr/local/src/imscp# perl imscp-autoinstall -dr alt_urls_feature
```

and answer `yes` to the question.

As a reminder, the alternative URLs feature make customers able to access their
site through alternative URLs.

### APT /etc/apt/sources.list file

i-MSCP now provides its own `/etc/apt/sources.list` configuration file. If you
need to add your own APT repositories, you should put them under the
`/etc/apt/sources.list.d` directory.

See [SOURCES.LIST(5)](https://manpages.debian.org/stretch/apt/sources.list.5.en.html)
for further details.

If you really want provide your own `/etc/apt/sources.list` file, you can
always make use of the [Listener::APT::Source::List](../contrib/Listeners/APT/10_apt_sources_list.pl)
i-MSCP listener file. If you do so, you'll have to make sure that the required Debian, Ubuntu
or Devuan repositories are present for the expected suite and components.

Note that no support will be provided by our team if your `/etc/apt/sources.list` file doesn't fit
with i-MSCP pre-requisites.

### Distributions

Support for Debian 10/Buster (testing) has been added. Note that support is
still experimental and that this version is not ready yet for production use.

### Dovecot configuration

It is now possible to override the default Dovecot configuration by adding
configuration files into the `/etc/dovecot/imscp.d` directory.

That is now the recommended way to customize the Dovecot configuration. The
configuration files that are put into the `/etc/dovecot/imscp.d` directory are
kept in place when updating/reconfiguring i-MSCP, excepted the configuration
files that are bound to the i-MSCP dovecot listener files, that is, those ending
by `_listener.conf`. For instance: `30_dovecot_namespace_listener.conf`

### i-MSCP frontEnd

#### Dependencies

The frontend dependencies are now installed through the [PHP
dependency manager (composer)](https://getcomposer.org/).

Current dependencies are as follows:

- Net_DNS2 - Native PHP5 DNS Resolver and Updater(v1.4.x)
- PHP Secure Communications Library (v2.0.x)
- Pure PHP IDNA Converter (v1.1.x)
- Zend Escaper component (v2.5.x)
- Zend Framework (v1.12.x)

### HTML Templates

HTML templates, including HTML template blocks defined within them, are now
resolved only once, and put in cache for faster processing.

If you need to develop something for the i-MSCP frontEnd, you must not forget
to disable both the OPcode cache (OPcache) and the userland cache (APCu).

- You can disable OPcache by editing the `/usr/local/etc/imscp_panel/php.ini`
file and by restarting the imscp_panel service, or by editing the
`/etc/imscp/frontend/frontend.data` file and by triggering an i-MSCP
reconfiguration.
- You can disable APCu by enabling the debugging mode in the
`/etc/imscp/imscp.conf` file.

### PHP version

The i-MSCP FrontEnd now makes use of the best supported PHP version
(currently PHP 7.1), regadless of the selected PHP alternative. In other words,
even when the PhpSwitcher plugin is not used, the PHP version used by the
i-MSCP frontEnd can be other than the PHP version used by customers.

Note that you still need the PhpSwitcher plugin if you want make your customers
able to switch between different PHP versions.

### i-MSCP master SQL user (imscp_user)

Following our security policy hardening, authentication data that belong to the
i-MSCP master SQL user are no longer stored into the
`/etc/mysql/conf.d/imscp.cnf` configuration file.

In previous versions, the `root` user was able to connect to SQL server through
`MYSQL(1)` command-line tool, and perform SQL backup using `MYSQLDUMP(1)`
without having to enter any user credentials.

With this new version, that is no longer possible, unless the `unix_socket`
authentication plugin is enabled for the user.

For people that have lost the i-MSCP master SQL user password, or that have
made an unattended i-MSCP installation, they can always recover it by executing
the [get_imscp_master_sql_user_pwd.pl](../contrib/scripts/get_imscp_master_sql_user_pwd.pl) 
Perl script. For instance:

```shell
root@stretch:/usr/local/src/imscp# perl contrib/scripts/get_imscp_master_sql_user_pwd.pl 
[INFO]  Your i-MSCP master SQL user is         : imscp_user
[INFO]  Your i-MSCP master SQL user password is: 7U4Bk2cmANuicQ7P
[WARN]  Information based on data from your /etc/imscp/imscp.conf file.
```

### Network setup

From now on and if the administrator explicitely set the primary server IP with
the `None` option, the `INADDR_ANY` IP address will be used in all cases,
regardless of the current IP assigned to domains.

For Apache2 this means that wildcard will be used in place of an IP address in
vhost files.

See also: [1.4.x errata -- Network setup](1.4.x_errata.md#network-setup)

#### Primary server IP

When the primary server IP is reconfigured, it is now possible to ask the
installer to replace the IP address of all client by that new IP address.

### PHP

All available PHP versions are now installed, regardless of the selected PHP
alternative. Doing this will make it possible to enhance the `PhpSwitcher`
plugin by using PHP versions as provided by Ondřej Surý PHP repositories
instead of relying on self compiled PHP versions.

### Plugins compatibility

#### i-MSCP DebugBar plugin

The `DebugBar` plugin versions older than `2.0.0` are not compatible with this
new i-MSCP version. You **MUST** uninstall your current version prior any
i-MSCP update attempt.

#### i-MSCP Instant SSH plugin

The `InstantSSH` plugin versions older than `6.0.0` are not compatible with
this new i-MSCP version. YOU **MUST** deactivate your current version prior any
i-MSCP update attempt. Once you have updated your i-MSCP installation, you
**MUST** upload the newest `InstantSSH` plugin version prior re-activating it.

#### i-MSCP CronJobs plugin

The `CronJobs` plugin versions older than `2.0.0` are not compatible with
this new i-MSCP version. YOU **MUST** deactivate your current version prior any
i-MSCP update attempt. Once you have updated your i-MSCP installation, you
**MUST** upload the newest `CronJobs` plugin version prior re-activating it.

#### i-MSCP RoundcubePlugins plugin

The Roundcube plugins provided by older versions of the `RoundcubePlugins`
plugin are not all compatible with Roundcube `1.3.1`, the new provided Roundcube
version.

Once you have updated your i-MSCP installation, you **SHOULD** really considere
upgrading the `RoundcubePlugins` plugin to latest version as provided in our
plugin store.

## Supported SQL servers

Support for older SQL servers versions has been dropped. From now on, the
following versions are supported:

- MariaDB ≥ 10.1
- MySQL ≥ 5.7
- Percona ≥ 5.7

If you really want use an older SQL server version, you can always make use of
the [Packages](../contrib/Listeners/Packages/10_packages_override.pl) listener
file to provide your own packages file. However, bear in mind that no support
will be provided by our team in such a case.

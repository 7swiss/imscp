# i-MSCP 1.6.x Serie (Ennio Morricone) -- Errata

First of all, if you're updating from an older i-MSCP Serie, you **MUST** read
the [previous errata](1.5.x_errata.md) file from bottom to top.

## Version 1.6.0

### Alternative URLs feature

Due to a bug found in previous versions and which has been fixed in this
version, people that want make use of the alternative URLs feature must run the
installer as follow:

```shell
root@buster:/usr/local/src/imscp# perl imscp-autoinstall -dr alt_urls_feature
```

and answer `yes` to the question.

As a reminder, the alternative URLs feature make customers able to access their
site through alternative URLs.

### APT /etc/apt/sources.list file

i-MSCP now provides its own `/etc/apt/sources.list` configuration file. If you
need to add your own APT repositories, you should put them under the
`/etc/apt/sources.list.d` directory. See `SOURCES.LIST(5)` for further details.

If you really want provide your own `/etc/apt/sources.list` file, you can
always make use of the [Listener::APT::Source::List](../contrib/Listeners/APT/10_apt_sources_list.pl)
i-MSCP listener file. If you do so, you'll have to make sure that the required Debian, Ubuntu
or Devuan repositories are present for the expected suite and components.

### Distributions

Support for Debian 10/Buster has been added. Note that support is still
experimental and that this version is not ready yet for production use.

### Dovecot configuration

It is now possible to override the default Dovecot configuration by adding
configuration files into the `/etc/dovecot/imscp.d` directory.

That is the new recommended way to customize the Dovecot configuration. The
configuration files that are put into the `/etc/dovecot/imscp.d` directory are
kept in place when updating/reconfiguring i-MSCP, excepted the configuration
files that are bound to the i-MSCP dovecot listener files, that is, those ending
by `_listener.conf`. For instance: `30_dovecot_namespace_listener.conf`

### i-MSCP FrontEnd dependencies

The frontend dependencies are now installed through the [PHP
dependency manager (composer)](https://getcomposer.org/).

### i-MSCP master SQL user (imscp_user)

Following our security policy hardening, authentication data that belong to the
i-MSCP master SQL user are no longer stored into the
`/etc/mysql/conf.d/imscp.cnf` configuration file.

In previous versions, the `root` user was able to connect to SQL server through
`MYSQL(1)` command-line tool, and perform SQL backup using `MYSQLDUMP(1)`
without having to enter any user credentials.

With this new version, that is no longer possible, unless the `unix_socket`
authentication plugin is enabled for the user.

For people that have lost the i-MSCP master SQL user password, or that have
made an unattended i-MSCP installation, they can always recover it by executing
the [get_imscp_master_sql_user_pwd.pl](../contrib/scripts/get_imscp_master_sql_user_pwd.pl) 
Perl script. For instance:

```shell
root@stretch:/usr/local/src/imscp# perl contrib/scripts/get_imscp_master_sql_user_pwd.pl 
[INFO]  Your i-MSCP master SQL user is         : imscp_user
[INFO]  Your i-MSCP master SQL user password is: 7U4Bk2cmANuicQ7P
[WARN]  Information based on data from your /etc/imscp/imscp.conf file.
```

### Network setup

From now on and if the administrator explicitely set the primary server IP with
the `None` option, the `INADDR_ANY` IP address will be used in all cases,
regardless of the current IP assigned to domains.

For Apache2 this means that wildcard will be used in place of an IP address in
vhost files.

### Plugins compatibility

#### i-MSCP DebugBar plugin

The `DebugBar` plugin versions older than `2.0.0` are not compatible with this
new i-MSCP version. You **MUST** uninstall your current version prior any
i-MSCP update attempt.

#### i-MSCP Instant SSH plugin

The `InstantSSH` plugin versions older than `6.0.0` are not compatibile with
this new i-MSCP version. YOU **MUST** deactivate your current version prior any
i-MSCP update attempt. Once you have updated your i-MSCP installation, you
**MUST** upload the newest `InstantSSH` plugin version prior re-activating it.

#### i-MSCP RoundcubePlugins plugin

The Roundcube plugins provided by older versions of the `RoundcubePlugins`
plugin are not all compatible with Roundcube `1.3.1`, the new provided Roundcube
version.

Once you have updated your i-MSCP installation, you **SHOULD** really considere
upgrading the `RoundcubePlugins` plugin to latest version as provided in our
plugin store.

## Supported SQL servers

Support for SQL servers that are too old has been removed:

- MariaDB < 10.1
- MySQL < 5.7
- Percona < 5.7

if you really want use an older SQL server version, you can always make use of
the [Packages](../contrib/Listeners/Packages/10_packages_override.pl)
listener file to provide your own packages file.

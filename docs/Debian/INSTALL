4) Installation
---------------

Make sure you are logged in as root and MySQL is running.

1.  Untar or unzip the distribution files to a secure directory

	# cd /usr/local/src
	# tar xjvf imscp-1.0.1.5.tar.bz2

2.  Change to the newly created directory

	# cd ./imscp-1.0.1.5

3.  Install the required packages

    First update your system:

        # aptitude update && aptitude safe-upgrade

   Make sure you have added the contrib and non-free into your /etc/apt/sources.list:

    Squeeze:
        deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian/ squeeze main contrib non-free
        deb http://security.debian.org/ squeeze/updates main contrib non-free

    Wheezy:
        deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian/ wheezy main contrib non-free
        deb http://security.debian.org/ wheezy/updates main contrib non-free

   Install all required packages:

        # aptitude install lsb-release
        # aptitude install $(cat ./docs/Debian/debian-packages-`lsb_release -cs`)

    (if you get to the courier screen select 'no' to web directories)
	(if you get to the postfix screen select 'internet site'. 'mail name' should
	be the server's domain. If you've set debian up correctly on install your
	domain should be already shown.)
	(if you get to the proftpd screen, select 'standalone')

4.  (optional) Check the imscp.conf and adapt it to your requirements

5.  Build the i-MSCP directory tree

	# ./imscp-build

6.  Copy all directories into your system. If you have not yet, now is a good time to
    make backups of your server. The following steps do fundamental changes to your
    system configuration

	# cp -R /tmp/imscp/* /

7.  Change or create MySQL root password, remove anonymous users, disallow root login
    remotely, remove test database (and access to it), reload privilege tables

	# mysql_secure_installation

8.  Now it's time to set up the frontend. Change into the engine directory and start
    the engine setup

	# cd /var/www/imscp/engine/setup
	# perl imscp-setup

9. Install i-MSCP step-by-step

	If you get no error, all went good; if you get one, look at
	http://i-mscp.net to solve the problem.

10. Clean the temporary folder

	# rm -Rf /tmp/imscp/

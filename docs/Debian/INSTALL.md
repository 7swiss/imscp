## i-MSCP installation on Debian

### 1) Requirements

- 1 GHz or faster 32 bits (x86) or 64 bits (x64) processor (recommended)
- 1 Gio memory (minimum) - For heavily loaded servers or high flow is recommended at least 16 Gio
- 2 Gio of available hard disk space for i-MSCP and managed services, excluding user data
- Internet access (at least 100 Mbits/s recommended)
- A file system supporting extended attributes such as ext2, ext3, ext4 and reiserfs*.
- System supporting bind mounts

#### Reiserfs users

In order, to use the reiserfs file system with i-MSCP, you must follow these steps:

Edit your `/etc/fstab` file to add the `attrs` option for your device (e.g. device containing the /var partition). For
instance:

```
UUID=74699091-3ab8-43f2-bdd5-d1d898ab50fd /     reiserfs notail          0    1
```

should be updated to:

```
UUID=74699091-3ab8-43f2-bdd5-d1d898ab50fd /     reiserfs notail,attrs    0    1
```

Once you did that, you can remount your device. For instance:

```
# mount -o remount /dev/disk/by-uuid/74699091-3ab8-43f2-bdd5-d1d898ab50fd
```

*Note:* If needed, you can find the uuid of your device, with the following command:

```
# blkid <device>
```

where `<device>` must be replaced by your device path such as `/dev/sda1`

#### LXC users

If you want install i-MSCP inside a LXC container, the following conditions have to be met:

- You must have the `CAP_MKNOD` capability inside the container. Thus, you must ensure that `mknod` is not in the list
  of dropped capabilities
- You must have the `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` capability inside the container (needed for mount(8)). Thus, you must ensure that
  `sys_admin` is not in the list of dropped capabilities.
- You must allow the creation of devices inside the container by white-listing them. Easy solution is to add
  `lxc.cgroup.devices.allow = a *:* rwm` in LXC container configuration file.
- If you use `Apparmor`, you must allow bindmounts inside your container by modifying the default apparmor profile
  `/etc/apparmor.d/lxc/lxc-default` or by creating a specific apparmor profile for the container.

Note that these operations must be done on the host, not in the container.

#### OpenVZ users (Proxmox and Virtuozzo)

You could have to increase the `fs.ve-mount-nr` limit, else, an error such as `mount: Cannot allocate memory` could be
threw by CageFS. To avoid this problem you must:

- Increase the limit by adding an entry such as `fs.ve-mount-nr = 4096` to your `/etc/sysctl.conf` file
- Make the new limit effective by executing the `sysctl -p` command

Note that these operations must be done on the host, not in the container.

#### Supported Debian versions

Any released version >= 7.x (Debian 8.x recommended)

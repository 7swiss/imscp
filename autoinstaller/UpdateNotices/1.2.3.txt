=======================\Zn\ZB

\Zb\Z4## Plugins\Zn\ZB

Major changes were made in the plugin API, which break compatibility with old plugins versions. Therefore, before updating to this new version, you must disable all plugins.

Once that the update is done, you must update each plugin by uploading the last version available from our plugin store.

Be aware that some plugins are not yet ready for use with this new version, such as the \ZbMailman\ZB and \ZbOwnDDNS\ZB plugins which require further works.

Plugin which are known to work with this new version clearly states that they are compatible with i-MSCP version >= \Zb1.2.3\ZB.

\Zb\Z4## Services\Zn\ZB

Before updating to this new version, it is recommended to stop the i-MSCP services manually as follow:

        \Zb# service imscp_panel stop
        # service imscp_daemon stop
        # service imscp_network stop\ZB
